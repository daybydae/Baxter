<h1> Baxter

<h3> Summary </h3>
Baxter is a single-page full-stack web application inspired by Rover built using Ruby on Rails on the backend, a PostgreSQL database, and React.js with a Redux architectural framework on the frontend.

Baxter enables users to search for dog sitters according to location, price, sitter availability, and other preferences, and allows them to send a request to book a dog sitter.
